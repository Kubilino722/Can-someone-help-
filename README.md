So i was just doing something in the "Windows PowerShell" and i was going to install something but when it almost have finished, error messages poped up.
These are the messages: "File "<string>", line 8, in <module>
      RuntimeError: uvloop does not support Windows at the moment
      [end of output]

  note: This error originates from a subprocess, and is likely not a problem with pip.
error: subprocess-exited-with-error

× Getting requirements to build wheel did not run successfully.
│ exit code: 1
╰─> See above for output.

So does anyone know a solution to this?
